The following report contains an analysis of the data from 2015. 

## Analysis
A simple linear model was fitted to the data to determine the main factors that contribute to a change in the dependent variable. We can see below some simple summaries of the data.

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
library(mangoTraining)
summary(pkData$Conc)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(Time, Conc, data = pkData)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(pkData))
```
